*** Week 2

***** Part 1: 'pollutantmean'
      Write a function, 'pollutantmean' that calculates the mean of a
      pollutant across list of monitors (csv files). Given three arguments:
       - directory
       - pollutant
       - id
Returns
 - mean of pollutant across monitors
   - Ignore missing value (NA)
   
******* Prototype
#+NAME: Part 1
 #+BEGIN_SRC R :tangle  ./rprog031/R/Ex1.R
pollutantmean <- function(directory, pollutant, id = 1:332) {
        ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the location of the CSV files

        ## 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the name of the pollutant for which we will calculate the
        ## mean; either "sulfate" or "nitrate".

        ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers
        ## to be used

        ## Return the mean of the pollutant across all monitors list
        ## in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values)
        ## NOTE: Do not round the result!
}
 #+END_SRC

***** Part 2: 
Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the
number of completely observed cases in each data file. The function
should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the
file and the second column is the number of complete cases. A
prototype of this function follows
#+NAME: Part 2
 #+BEGIN_SRC R :tangle  ./rprog031/R/Ex1.R
complete <- function(directory, id = 1:332) {
        ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the location of the CSV files

        ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers
        ## to be used
        
        ## Return a data frame of the form:
        ## id nobs
        ## 1  117
        ## 2  1041
        ## ...
        ## where 'id' is the monitor ID number and 'nobs' is the
        ## number of complete cases
}
