* Tuftie's Principles
  Edward Tuftie's (2006) "Beautiful Evidence" www.edwardtuftie.com
*** Show Comparisons
    - Evidence is always relative
    - Always ask "compared to what"?
    - e.g. two box plot "control" vs what is being studied
*** Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic stucture
    Show how you think the world works -- causal framework for
    thinking about question.
*** Show multivatiate data:
    or, show as much data on a plot as you possibly can. The world is complex.
*** Integration of Evidence
    Combine different modes of evidence to make your graphic as
    information rich as possible. Don't let the tools drive the analysis.
*** Describe and document the evidence you present:
    Include the R source you 
*** Content is King
    Analytical presintations ultimately stand and fall on the quality
    of their content.
* Exploratory Graphs
*** Why use graphs?
    - Understand data properties
    - Find patterns in data
    - Suggest modeling strategies
    - "Debug" analyses
    - Communicate results.
*** Charecteristics of Exploratory Graphs
    - Made quickly
    - Made in large quantities
    - Goal is personal understanding
    - Color/size are primarily used for information.
